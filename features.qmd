## üöÄ TALL Workflow

TALL offers a seamless and structured workflow that guides users from raw text to interpretable insights ‚Äî no programming required.

1. **Import** text data from a variety of sources and formats: `.txt`, `.csv`, `.xlsx`, `.pdf`, Wikipedia pages, or Biblioshiny export files.  
2. **Pre-process** texts using integrated NLP techniques ‚Äî including tokenization, lemmatization, PoS-tagging, and semantic filtering.  
3. **Analyze** your corpus with multiple modules: word frequencies, co-occurrence networks, correspondence analysis, clustering, topic modeling, summarization, and more.  
4. **Visualize & Export** results as high-quality plots, structured tables, or `.tall` files for further use and reproducibility.

## üóÇÔ∏è Text Import & Metadata Integration

- Load raw text files in various formats

- Import `.tall` structured files to resume previous sessions

- Import data directly from Biblioshiny ‚Äì the Shiny web interface of [bibliometrix](www.bibliometrix.org), the R package for science mapping

- Dynamically add metadata, split documents, or group them based on external information

## üßπ Advanced Preprocessing Pipeline

TALL includes a robust and modular preprocessing engine that prepares text data for advanced analysis through:

-   **PoS-tagging and lemmatization** powered by pre-trained models based on the Universal Dependencies framework  
-   **Multilingual support**, including a wide range of languages and domain-specific variants tailored for social media, news, and scientific texts  
-   **Semantic tagging** of special entities and automated **multi-word expression** detection  
-   Flexible filtering and grouping of tokens or lemmas, based on user-defined criteria or external metadata

All preprocessing operations are transparent, reproducible, and designed to ensure consistent input quality for downstream analyses.

## üìä Descriptive Statistics & Lexical Insights

A set of tools for exploring the lexical structure of your corpus, including:

-   Vocabulary distributions and **TF-IDF** weighting  
-   **Word clouds** for visualizing term prominence  
-   **Word in Context** analysis and **semantic ego-networks** to examine word usage patterns

These tools allow users to investigate specific terms within their full textual context ‚Äî across documents, sentences, or defined groups ‚Äî supporting both qualitative interpretation and quantitative analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìà Topic Detection

Methods to uncover latent themes and conceptual structures within a corpus, supporting both statistical and linguistic approaches:

-   **Correspondence Analysis (CA)** to identify and visualize associations between terms and documents  
-   **Topic Modelign with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** for probabilistic topic modeling and distribution-based interpretation  
-   **Reinert Clustering** to segment texts into lexically homogeneous clusters based on word co-occurrence  
-   **Word Embedding** to explore semantic similarity through vector space representations of terms

Each method includes options for parameter tuning, model selection (e.g., CaoJuan index for LDA), and rich graphical outputs to support interpretation and comparison.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üåê Network Analysis

Construct and explore networks that reveal the relational structure of language within a corpus:

-   Build **co-occurrence networks** based on term‚Äìdocument or term‚Äìsentence matrices  
-   Perform **community detection** through clustering algorithms to uncover semantic groupings  
-   Compute and visualize key **network metrics**, such as centrality, density, and modularity  
-   Analyze networks of **words**, **multi-word expressions**, **emojis**, and **named entities**

These tools help uncover underlying conceptual structures and patterns of term association, supporting both exploratory insight and hypothesis generation.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üòÉ Sentiment & Polarity Detection

TALL offers built-in tools for sentiment and polarity analysis, leveraging multiple well-established lexical resources:

-   **Hu & Liu Opinion Lexicon** ‚Äì for general-purpose sentiment classification  
-   **Loughran-McDonald Dictionary** ‚Äì tailored to financial and economic texts  
-   **NRC Emotion Lexicon** ‚Äì capturing a wide range of emotional tones (e.g., joy, anger, trust)

Polarity is computed using context-sensitive rules that account for **negators**, **amplifiers**, and **de-amplifiers**, and results are normalized through a logistic scaling function. This enables a nuanced analysis of both sentiment orientation and emotional intensity at the document or sentence level.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìö Summarization

TALL includes an automatic summarization module based on **TextRank**, a graph-based extractive algorithm that identifies and ranks the most relevant sentences within a document. The method:

-   Constructs a similarity graph between sentences and ranks them by **centrality**  
-   Produces summaries of variable length, from concise overviews to more detailed extracts  
-   Visualizes sentence relevance to enhance interpretability and support manual refinement

This functionality helps users quickly distill key information from long documents, improving readability and supporting exploratory analysis.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üßæ Reporting and Export

TALL provides flexible options for saving, exporting, and reporting results at every stage of the analysis:

-   Save intermediate or final outputs as `.tall` files to resume or replicate sessions later  
-   Export charts and tables in common formats such as **Excel**, **CSV**, and **PNG**  
-   Automatically include selected results in a cumulative, editable **report**

These features ensure transparency, reproducibility, and ease of sharing across research teams or teaching contexts.


------------------------------------------------------------------------
