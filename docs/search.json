    "text": "üéØ Key Capabilities\nTALL AI enhances the interpretability of textual data by offering intelligent, context-aware support across all stages of analysis.\nIn the early phases, it assists with descriptive and lexical exploration, highlighting anomalies in vocabulary distribution, interpreting levels of lexical diversity and concentration, and identifying dominant linguistic patterns ‚Äî such as domain-specific jargon or repetitive structures.\nWhen working with topic modeling and clustering, TALL AI automatically suggests clear, meaningful labels for emergent topics and clusters. It links these structures to broader conceptual themes, while also detecting semantic overlaps or drifts that may occur across time, text genres, or author groups.\nIn network analysis, TALL AI interprets structural metrics such as density, modularity, and centrality. It helps users understand the organization of semantic communities and pinpoints key connectors or bridging terms between different conceptual areas.\nIn the context of sentiment and polarity detection, TALL AI provides narrative explanations of sentiment trends, clarifies the role of polarized terms within specific contexts, and draws attention to valence shifters or emotional dynamics present in the text.\nIn each of these areas, TALL AI transforms numerical output into actionable interpretation ‚Äî enabling more confident, insightful, and communicable results."
